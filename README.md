Ever had trouble deciding on a movie for your evening off? This Python project aims to facilitate seamless exploration of movies online.

This project has been broken down into 5 milestones, each given its own notebook with the corresponding name. In each notebook there are lists of tasks and spaces for code to be written in. Once one task is completed correctly, the user goes onto the next task.

## <b><FONT COLOR=" 00c1ff">Milestone 1</FONT></b>
For the first Milestone, the task is to immerse in the dataset and gain a comprehensive understanding of its contents. Whilst doing this task, its found that the python list 'movies' has five elements using the <b><FONT COLOR=" 00c1ff">len()</FONT></b> function. Each element of the list is a dictionary which can be checked using the <b><FONT COLOR=" 00c1ff">type()</FONT></b> function. Each dictionary contains the following information: title, description, genre, image_url and link. These can be used as keys to access the relevant data, for example movies[0]<b><FONT COLOR=" 00c1ff">["link"]</FONT></b>.

In this Milestone, the objectives are to explore the data, develop a set of functions and implement the necessary code to calculate and display essential information about the movies dataset.

The target for this section is to build the individual components of the system that will later be composed to produce the entire solution.

## <b><FONT COLOR=" 00c1ff">Milestone 4</FONT></B>
In this milestone, the functions defined so far are put together to build the complete movie assistant project. The goal is to write some code that will ask the user to select a genre and then select a movie from a list presented.
Once they do that, they should see the details of that movie printed.

Thus far the code that has been written is very fragile, and will easily break if the user selects an invalid genre or movie, for example. To fix this the aim is to raise the right errors in the right places.
